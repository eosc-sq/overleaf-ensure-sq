\subsection{Definition and references of Research SW}

% \dg{[summary discussion] The expectation of research software is that it can support the findings in a paper. In that sense, RS is "expected" to
% reproduce those findings, while regular software would not necessarily have this expectation (as long as it works).}

The goal of this section is to cross-reference the elements of
software quality from the previous section with the SG1 typology of
research software development, in order to identify the tools and
infrastructures needed to satisfy minimum quality criteria. 

Discussion on definition of research software \url{https://zenodo.org/record/5504016#.ZGc6SnbP2Uk}

As a reminder, SG1 has defined different categories of software
development related to the context in which they are performed. Others have different categories as well, for instance \url{https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uwxSwd8chbG7bVn5lPvNNhv5f_JeeelA2mN9NXhlOhA/edit#slide=id.g183ddf12e8b_0_122} and \url{https://zenodo.org/record/7589725#.ZGc5E3bP2Uk}

\subsection{Software Quality models: Survey}

We follow the methodology proposed by Kitchenham and Charters which has the following steps:

% \cite{kitchenham2007guidelines}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Source selection and search: We have searched in the Scopus dataset, including the top five journals in
    software engineering related to software \footnote{\url{https://research.com/journals-rankings/computer-science/software-programming}}
    and articles of the  "International Conference on Software Engineering", one of the top venues for Software engineering
    % \dg{citation needed. Also, add here something about the books we considered, or internal knowledge by the authors}.
    The search included the keywords "software quality" in the title of the target publications.
    % \dg{this can be improved, but we already obtain thousands of results}
    \item Inclusion and exclusion criteria: Excluded journals not in the SE domain. Excluded articles not written in English.
    \item Selection procedure:
    % \dg{skim article titles and abstracts. The process was performed by 2-3 people.Final list was agreed upon by the group. Explain what the agreement procedure was}
    \item Review process:
    % \dg{After following the selection procedure, we ended up with XX articles, which have been reviewed in this survey}
\end{enumerate}

Journals: IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, Empirical Software Engineering, Journal of Systems and Software, Software \& Systems Modeling, 
Information and Software Technology, IEEE Software, Software Quality Journal. Query used:

\begin{verbatim}
    TITLE ( software  AND quality )  AND

        OR  LIMIT-TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE ,  "Proceedings International Conference On Software Engineering" )

        )  AND  ( LIMIT-TO ( SUBJAREA ,  "COMP" )  OR  LIMIT-TO ( SUBJAREA ,  "ENGI" ) )  
\end{verbatim}

As a result, we obtained 272 results. Additional filtering: excluding papers with no abstracts, proceedings/workshop summary,
and removed those which did not seem related by browsing the abstract and title. Also, removed those papers that did not seem to propose
quality dimensions (e.g., if they talk about practices)
