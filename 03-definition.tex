% \miguel{Indeed,having a section in the final document where we give definitions of "quality", "software", "research software", etc. is
% quite convenient. It doesn't mean other definitions are not possible, but we need to settle clearly what we're discussing in our own context.}
% Criteria of quality (brainstorming, to complete by everybody)

% \miguel{For scientific research: reviewed by other peers, reproducible (data + sources, matching the article), Open Access.}

% \dg{We should look at the FAIR4RS reports for the alignment for quality dimensions. In a sense, this is what FAIR aims (at a basic level).}

% \miguel{One quality criteria: reproducibility. Define "reproducibility" and "repeatability". Different levels of reproducibility. Bottom level:
% black box (being able to obtain the same results given the same inputs). Higher level: full access to a well-commented source code, and checking
% that the pseudocode matches well the implementation. In the case of a scientific publication, checking that the implementation matches exactly
% what the descriptions in the article.}

% \dg{We should first define what we understand by software. We can reuse the definition in FAIR4RS.}

% These refer to the work done on identifying Quality Models and Attributes - table under discussion as of March 2023
% DONE -> \dg{Missing the initial table here, although we had only summaries. We should see how each of those papers defined software quality dimensions.}

% DONE -> \eli{Concerning Quality Definition, there are various software models and standards that can be referred.
% However, the most recent ones are ISO and IEEE. Existing models and standards provide a full set of software characteristics: unfortunately
% they quite often have different meaning and do not have a match with software metrics used to measure software characteristics.}

    \\ \hline
    
    Compatibility &
    Degree to which a product, system or component can exchange information with other products, systems or components, and/or perform its required functions, while sharing the same hardware or software environment. &
    Adapted from ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765.
    \\ \hline
    
    Installability &
    Degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which a product or system can be successfully installed and/or uninstalled in a specified environment. &
    -
    \\ \hline
    
    Technical accessibility &
    Degree to which a product or system can be used by people with the widest range of characteristics and capabilities to achieve a specified goal in a specified context of use. &
    The range of capabilities includes disabilities associated with age. Accessibility for people with disabilities can be specified or measured either as the extent to which a product or system can be used by users with specified disabilities to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, freedom from risk and satisfaction in a specified context of use, or by the presence of product properties that support accessibility.
    \\ \hline
    
    Portability /Adaptability &
    Degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which a system, product or component can be transferred from one hardware, software or other operational or usage environment to another. &

\subsection{Software Quality attributes}

The metrics and attributes where subdivided into four categories and for each metric or attribute,
a new codename was created by the EOSC Task Force:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Source Code Metrics (\textbf{EOSC-SCMet}):
    \item Time metrics (\textbf{EOSC-TMet}):
    \item Qualitative Attributes (\textbf{EOSC-Qual}):
    \item DevOps/Automation Attributes (\textbf{EOSC-DevOps}):
\end{itemize}

In the following subsections, is show in bold the EOSC Task Force codename, the name and
one or more characteristics defined in the section "Software Quality characteristics", it is
followed by a table containing the source information about the metric or attribute, i.e. the
reference paper or article, the codename defined there and its definition. In several cases,
the same (or similar) metric or attribute appears in different papers.
